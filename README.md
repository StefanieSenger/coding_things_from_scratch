## Stochatic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Making sense of [stochatic gradient descent (SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) by following [this tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/optimize-regression-models/) on optimising the [Residual sum of squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_sum_of_squares) and, more importantly, [that one](https://regenerativetoday.com/stochastic-gradient-descent-explanation-and-complete-implementation-from-scratch/) on gradient descent, that didn't run on it's own, because there were so many issues, that I really had to get behind it.
