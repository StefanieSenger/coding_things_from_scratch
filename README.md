# Coding things from scratch

Here, I try out ML algorithms from scratch for learning purpose.

## Optimisation Algorithms

### Stochatic hill climbing
Using a brute-force [stochastic hill climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_hill_climbing) method  for optimising the [Residual sum of squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_sum_of_squares) (RSS) with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the objective function following [this nice tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/optimize-regression-models/).

### Stochatic Gradient Descent
Making sense of [stochatic gradient descent (SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent) by following [this tutorial](https://regenerativetoday.com/stochastic-gradient-descent-explanation-and-complete-implementation-from-scratch/) on gradient descent, that didn't run on its own, because there were several issues, so I really had to get behind it.
